name: "Psiger"
bio: "Psiger is a Psytrance YouTuber & Artist. He programmed his first beats on an Amiga Commodore as a child. Looking for techniques to reach a trance state he discovered Psytrance, or as some say Psytrance called him. For Psiger music is a tool for expressing and exploring the inner self, a feeling of ecstasy. Each layer of his music dives into the body and the mind in its way. Come on a trippy journey into a world you never assumed existed. Close your eyes, and surrender to the vibe."
