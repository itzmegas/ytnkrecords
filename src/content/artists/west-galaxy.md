bio: "West Galaxy emerges as the brainchild of two Argentine visionaries, Sebastian Hertzog and Franco Moyano, distinguished producers specializing in Psytrance and Full-On genres. Their journey kicked off in 2020 with a groundbreaking debut on Digital Om, solidifying their presence in the scene and subsequently finding a home in the esteemed label Maharetta, where they've remained ever since. The duo's ascent has been nothing short of meteoric, earning them significant recognition on Beatport with multiple appearances on the charts, even securing the coveted top spot in releases on numerous occasions. Their collaborative efforts with renowned artists such as MoRsei, Hypnoise, and Amplify have resonated globally, imprinting their sonic signature across diverse tracks around the world. With each release, West Galaxy's musical tapestry evolves, gradually shaping the project into a dynamic force."
